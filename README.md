# Global Suicide Rates & Socioeconomic Trends Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the complex relationship between global suicide rates and socioeconomic indicators (GDP, HDI, Age, and Generation) over a 30-year period. By blending quantitative data with qualitative insights from journalistic archives, this study identifies high-risk demographics and provides a data-driven foundation for public health intervention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Data Processing:** SQL (BigQuery/PostgreSQL) – Used for cleaning, joining, and aggregating fragmented datasets.
* **Visualization:** Tableau – Developed interactive dashboards to visualize geospatial trends and demographic shifts.
* **AI Synthesis:** NotebookLM – Utilized to synthesize research papers and **newspaper findings** to add societal context to the statistical data.
* **Documentation:** Markdown.

## 🔍 The Approach

I followed the Data Analysis Life Cycle to ensure a rigorous and ethical exploration of this sensitive topic:

1. **Ask:** Defined key questions regarding which age groups and economic conditions correlate most strongly with suicide rates.
2. **Prepare & Process:** Cleaned 30+ years of data using **SQL**. Standardized HDI (Human Development Index) and GDP figures to ensure longitudinal accuracy across different nations.
3. **Analyze:** Conducted a "mixed-methods" analysis. While SQL provided the numbers, **NotebookLM** helped analyze **newspaper archives** to cross-reference mortality spikes with specific historical economic crises.
4. **Share:** Created a **Tableau** dashboard that allows stakeholders to filter data by country, year, and generation.

## 💡 Key Insights

* **Economic Correlation:** While lower GDP often correlates with higher rates, sudden economic "shocks" (reported in media) showed a more significant impact on specific working-age demographics than absolute poverty levels.
* **Generational Trends:** Identified specific "at-risk" generations where rates have not declined in line with global averages.
* **Geospatial Hotspots:** Visualized regional clusters that require prioritized mental health resource allocation.

## 🚀 Impact

The results of this analysis bridge the gap between raw mortality statistics and the societal narratives found in journalism. This holistic view enables NGOs and policymakers to move beyond general awareness and toward **targeted, demographic-specific prevention.**
